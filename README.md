Title---
This project was developed as part of the UIDAI Hackathon with the objective of analyzing citizen awareness and dependency on offline Aadhaar services using Aadhaar update data.
The core idea is to quantify awareness of online Aadhaar update facilities and identify regions where offline dependency is high, so that UIDAI and government bodies can plan targeted awareness campaigns.



Key Idea & Assumptions---
•	Biometric updates act as a proxy for unavoidable offline usage
•	Excess offline demographic updates indicate lack of awareness
•	Regions with high offline demographic fraction likely have:
o	Low digital awareness
o	Poor access to online facilities
o	Higher dependency on physical Aadhaar centers




Conclusion
This project provides a data-driven framework to:
•	Measure digital awareness
•	Identify offline dependency hotspots
•	Assist UIDAI in evidence-based policymaking
The methodology is scalable, interpretable, and directly applicable to real-world governance challenges
